            <p>REGINA. [Looking hard at him.] What are you going to fool Pastor Manders
                into doing, this time?
                
                ENGSTRAND. Sh! sh! Are you crazy? Do _I_ want to fool Pastor Manders? Oh
                no! Pastor Manders has been far too good a friend to me for that. But I
                just wanted to say, you know--that I mean to be off home again to-night.
                
                REGINA. The sooner the better, say I.
                
                ENGSTRAND. Yes, but I want you with me, Regina.
                
                REGINA. [Open-mouthed.] You want me--? What are you talking about?
                
                ENGSTRAND. I want you to come home with me, I say.
                
                REGINA. [Scornfully.] Never in this world shall you get me home with
                you.</p>
