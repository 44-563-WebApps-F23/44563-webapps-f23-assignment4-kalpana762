            <h4>Ghosts Act 1 by Henrik Ibsen</h4>
            <h6>REGINA.</h6>
            <p> [Looking hard at him.]</p>
            <p1> What are you going to fool Pastor Mander
                into doing, this time?</p1>
                <h6> ENGSTRAND.</h6>
                <p1>Sh! sh! Are you crazy? Do _I_ want to fool Pastor Manders? Oh
                no! Pastor Manders has been far too good a friend to me for that. But I
                just wanted to say, you know--that I mean to be off home again to-night.</p1>
                <h6>REGINA. </h6>
                <p1>The sooner the better, say I.</p1>
                <h6>ENGSTRAND.</h6>
                <p1>Yes, but I want you with me, Regina.</p1>
                <h6>REGINA.</h6>
                <p>[Open-mouthed.]</p>
                <p1> You want me--? What are you talking about?</p1>
                <h6>ENGSTRAND. </h6>
                <p1>I want you to come home with me, I say.</p1>
                <h6>REGINA. </h6>
                <p>[Scornfully.]</p>
                <p> Never in this world shall you get me home with
                you.</p>
