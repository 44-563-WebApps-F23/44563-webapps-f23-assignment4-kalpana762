            <p>REGINA. <br>[Looking hard at him.] What are you going to fool Pastor Manders
                into doing, this time?<br><br>
                ENGSTRAND. <br>Sh! sh! Are you crazy? Do _I_ want to fool Pastor Manders? Oh
                no! Pastor Manders has been far too good a friend to me for that. But I
                just wanted to say, you know--that I mean to be off home again to-night.<br><br>
                REGINA. <br>The sooner the better, say I.<br><br>
                ENGSTRAND.<br> Yes, but I want you with me, Regina.<br><br>
                REGINA.<br>[Open-mouthed.] You want me--? What are you talking about?<br><br>
                ENGSTRAND. <br>I want you to come home with me, I say.<br><br>
                REGINA. <br>[Scornfully.] Never in this world shall you get me home with
                you.</p>
